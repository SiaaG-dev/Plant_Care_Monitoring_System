# Plant_Care_Monitoring_System

Developed a real-time plant monitoring system to measure temperature and soil moisture using sensors readings on two bar graphs, automated water pump control via GPIO (pumps water when low moisture is detected), and audio-visual alerts for moisture levels, including a melody for low levels and a robotic voice for high levels (100% moisture).  The user is provided with a randomized plant care message after each reading and is able to go back to measure new temperature/moisture readings. Integrated with keyboard, audio, VGA and sensor.
